Document your detailed responses to the questions in Part A, in a 3-5
page WRITTEN REPORT. The Appendix to that report must include your python code. References must also be included in your report,
if appropriate—that is, if you consulted any literature references, online
sources, expert reports or testimony, etc., then these must be documented
in your Part C written report. This written report must illustrate the detail
and thinking behind Part B’s presentation.
